# Bank Interview: Project Overview

This repository contains materials for a bank interview project conducted as part of a data analyst role. 

The project consists of two main tasks:

1. Sales Data Analysis

2. Reporting

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is synthetic (not real data) and generated for demonstration purposes only. It includes simulated sales data for analysis.

## Task

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and reporting. The tasks are organized as follows:

## Sales Data Analysis

In this section, I utilized SQL code blocks to answer specific questions provided by the bank, such as retrieving sales information, calculating total sales amounts, and identifying top-selling products.

## Reporting

For reporting, I designed a structured report layout displaying sales information with relevant columns, such as Sale ID, Sale Date, Product Name, Quantity Sold, and Amount. Additionally, I included a summary section in the report with aggregated metrics, such as total sales amount and highest/lowest selling products.

## Organization

The repository is organized into folders:

**Question 1:** Contains a markdown file with the SQL queries and responses for the sales data analysis task.

**Question 2:** Contains subfolders:

- **Reports:** Includes initial CSV reports generated from Python in Jupyter Notebook format and final reports in Excel format. The final reports are enhanced with color-coding, bold formatting, and visualizations for improved readability. 
** Note: The formatting and visualization on the excel file does not appear in preview mode. You will have to download the file to view the customization.
- **Images:** Stores images of the visualizations generated for inclusion in the reports.
- **Code Notebook:** Contains a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code for generating the initial report. Each step is accompanied by explanations of the rationale behind the code implementation.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the relevant folder based on the task or question.
2. Review the provided materials, including code, reports, and explanations.
3. Execute the code and explore the reports to gain insights into the sales data analysis and reporting process.
